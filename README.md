# Tanisha Verma — Personal Portfolio

A premium, minimal, editorial portfolio designed with a Swiss-style layout, featuring advanced horizontal scrolling, custom micro-animations, and full-stack project showcases.

---

## ✨ Design & Aesthetic Philosophy

This portfolio is inspired by minimalist Swiss design which focuses on readability, structured bento layout grids, and subtle, high-end motion design:
- **Color Palette**: Cream (`hsl(36, 28%, 94%)`) and Ink (`hsl(0, 0%, 6%)`) for a high-contrast editorial look.
- **Typography**: Editorial serif headers (*Instrument Serif*) combined with clean monospace descriptors (*DM Mono*) and sans-serif content text (*Inter*).
- **Motion**: Fluid animations using GSAP and Lenis to create a smooth, unified interactive feel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Core**: React.js 18 & TypeScript
- **Bundler & Tooling**: Vite, ESLint
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer
- **Animations**:
  - [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) & ScrollTrigger (For pinning sections and horizontal timeline scrubbing)
  - [Lenis Scroll](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/) (For global smooth-scrolling and page transition interception)
  - [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (For interactive micro-interactions)
